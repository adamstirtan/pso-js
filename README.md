# Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Visualization

This repository contains a web application that visualizes the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The application uses HTML and JavaScript to create an interactive demonstration of how a particle swarm converges towards a global objective.

## Demo

To see the PSO visualization in action, you can visit the live demo at [https://adamstirtan.github.io/pso-js/](https://adamstirtan.github.io/pso-js/).

## Features

- Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm visualization.
- Interactive canvas: Set the objective point by dragging the mouse on the canvas.
- Dynamic control of PSO hyperparameters (Inertia, C1, C2) using sliders.

## Using the Experiment

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adamstirtan/pso-js.git
   ```

2. Open the index.html file in your web browser.
3. Interact with the PSO visualization by moving the mouse on the canvas and adjusting the hyperparameter sliders.
